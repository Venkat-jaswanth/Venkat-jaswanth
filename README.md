- I'm a pre-final year Computer Science student at IIIT Kottayam with a specialization in AI and Data Science. I'm passionate about using technology to build useful, user-friendly applications and solve complex problems with data-driven solutions.

My strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms is something I apply every day, whether I'm designing a backend service or optimizing a front-end component. I have hands-on experience developing full-stack applications using the MERN stack and believe the best way to learn is by building. I am always exploring new technologies to grow my skills; right now, I'm diving into Java Spring Boot and TypeScript.

I am actively seeking Software Engineering internship opportunities for 2026 where I can contribute my skills in either full-stack development or data science. I'm excited to learn from experienced teams and help tackle real-world challenges.
